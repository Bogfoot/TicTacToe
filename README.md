One of my 1st ever programs I made when I was 11 or 12. Found this on my PC yesterday, just a simple tic tac toe game. Don't get too angry if you can't win.

Added CMakeLists.txt and changed some style.

***How to build***
1. git clone https://github.com/Bogfoot/TicTacToe.git
2. mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake ..
4. cmake --build .
5. "Enjoy".

***Note***
I might actually make the AI work, I might not.
